And Turks & Caicos ReviewVenetian on Grace Bay provided just about everything one could need traveling with or without kids.  This property has approximately 25-30 total units, making it a quiet property even when all units are full.  Our particular unit #302 provided great views of Grace Bay including beautiful sunsets each evening (early at 5:30pm (ish) this time of year).  Expect to get first class service from Coleen & staff on arrival, during stay and at checkout. Everyone was very helpful with any questions we had.  They were able to assist with dinner recommendations, car rental, grocery pick up, shopping suggestions, water sport recommendations etc.  I've been to several beaches in Mexico, Cayman Islands, Australia beaches, Puerto Rico beaches and have never had sand this fine. This particular condo located on the far northeast end of Grace Bay was an awesome location where you didn't have to fight for a chair every morning.  This was valuable to us as we've had some bad experiences with big hotels in the past with this being an issue. It was nice being two doors down from Ocean Club hotel as this was full service and we could benefit having this next to us for meals (if we didn't want to make food in our condo). Very reasonably priced food, drinks and another great place to watch the sunset. Getting around on the island: We tried to walk quite a bit but your feet will only take you so far. Taxi services will charge you by the person & this can add up. We did rent a jeep one day and took it around the island for about $150. This was totally worth it as we went to Chalk Sound and Sapodilla Bay Beach..........you have to see these waters......unbelievable colors!!! Round trip to & from airport cost us (4 people) $210. Just want you to be prepared for the transportation expense. We thought everything else was very reasonably priced compared to other beach destinations. Restaurants: Coco Bistro (awesome); Hemmingways for breakfast (awesome view and almond pancakes, bonus that we saw JoJo the famous dolphin that everyone knows about on T&C).…Read moreDate of stay: February 2020ValueRoomsServiceRoom Tip: #302 was awesome. 3 bedroom 3.5 bath (but they made it a 2 bedroom 2.5 bath for us locking one of...See more room tipsHelpfulShare Response from VenetianGraceBay, Manager at The Venetian on Grace BayResponded 1 week agoSo very happy that you had such an enjoyable vacation with us at The Venetian on Grace Bay - our staff, the nearby restaurant, our beach, our ambiance and our location.

It was an ideal spot and the three bedroom suite was perfect.  The daily maid service is a big plus and the kitchen was very well equiped, no dishwasher but the maid washes the dishes. we had everything we needed.  We also made use of the full size washer and dryer.  The screened-in balcony kept the suite insect free and was a great safety feature for the kids. The concierge is very helpful regarding excursions and shopping advice.  There is no gift shop, no store and no restaurant at the facility, but the beachside cafe at the adjacent property is available, serves very good food and is only a short walk away.  The local grocery is store is a few miles away and is pretty pricey but has everything you need and most of what you might want.

We love this place for all of the reasons people rave about it, and we also love it for the thing that SOME complain about.  We love the fact there is no restaurant or bar on site.  We love the ability to do our own thing.  The staff are friendly and helpful across the board.  The facilities are well kept.  The beach is perfect.  The chairs are new.  There is ample seating.  The place was apparently \"full\" but it was delightfully quiet.  Our unit was outstanding.  I was surprised that the unit was even better than the one we had in 2018, as I didn't think it was possible.  Beautifully decorated.  Fully equipped.    We had absolutely ZERO issues.

I’ll keep this simple, it’s expensive here but if you can afford it then please do not hesitate.  My wife and I have travelled extensively throughout Mexico and the Caribbean and we’ve never been at a better location.  The Venetian and Grace Bay are a perfect combination.  The Venetian is at the very end of Grace Bay so beach traffic is minimal.  It’s also a condo, so no restaurants or bars.  There are 2 grocery stores, one about a 5 minute drive and the other about a 10 minute drive.  Expect the prices to be about double of US prices.  These grocery stores will have everything you can find in the US.  Regarding restaurants, there is one at the Ocean Club (<5 minute walk) and also a nice restaurant called Opus, which is just off the main road and also about 5 minutes.

It is quiet and not as crowded. The rooms are very roomy and clean. I would say cleaner than any hotel we have stayed in. The full-size kitchen is great and well stocked for the basic items you would need to cook with. They provide bottled water each day and clean beach towels.

My only complaint is that we didn’t stay longer. I knew going into it that it would be a condo as it clearly states, so we rented a car. There is a woman who takes orders from the beach for lunch and drinks from Ocean Club so that was very convenient.  Coco bistro and other restaurants are a few min car ride. They ask if you would like groceries prior to arriving,as the kitchen is fully stocked, and if you don’t use these services, there is a grocery store nearby.

I knew this coming in and this is exactly what I was looking for.  Extremely spacious, full kitchen and evey detail was thought of (unit 103).  There are plenty of food and drink options just a few steps away, Rooms are refreshed daily and they even provide a cellphone for local calls if necessary.  One of the last properties on Grace Bay so you almost feel like you have the area to yourself since the lot next to it is not developed.  Definitely coming back.Read moreDate of stay: June 2019HelpfulShare Response from VenetianGraceBay, Manager at The Venetian on Grace BayResponded 23 Jun 2019We're so very happy that you enjoyed your vacation with us - thanks for taking the time to write about your experience.  Many of our guests enjoy the three restaurant/bar choices that are nearby, i.e. Fairways, OPUS wine and steakhouse and Cabana Bar & Grill - and the downtown Grace Bay area restaurants are a mere 5 minute drive away from us!

Stayed with my family in a 3 bedroom unit and it was gorgeous! Full kitchen, bathroom in every bedroom, lovely living room and the most beautiful, huge, screened-in porch. The property is at the furthest end of the beach, so very quiet and almost too quiet when we were there off season. The Staff was helpful, but even with a personal cell phone, at times you had to find them to enlist their help... Beach was beautiful with chairs, umbrellas and a shower located on the beach right before the walkway back to the your room. Also, golf course is a 10 minute walk from the property and it is a beautiful course!! The cons: This is not a hotel, this is a condo/apartment complex. There are beautiful tennis courts, beaches a pool, beach front, but no…Read moreDate of stay: May 2019HelpfulShare Response from VenetianGraceBay, Manager at The Venetian on Grace BayResponded 23 Jun 2019Thanks for taking the time to write a review about your stay with us - we appreciate it very much.

We are a family of 6 so the 3 bedroom condo units are perfect for us.  I am freakish about cleanliness and I can report that after inspecting every corner of the condo unit for any trace of previous visitors - I came up empty handed - it was truly spotless!  The condos are very spacious and well appointed, and the large screened-in balcony overlooking the ocean is divine.  The beach is wide and pristine in front of the Venetian and we really appreciate being at the end of Grace Bay, away from all the crowds!

The views from the balcony are amazing, the furniture on the balcony and in the unit are great, the beds are good, and the showers and kitchen are outstanding.  The location is at the very end of the beach so it is very quite and there is never any issue with getting beach chairs.  However, just remember, you are not going to have somebody coming around to bring you drinks and stuff like at a hotel.  That is the trade off, but don't be too concerned because just a short walk down the beach there is a place to get lunch and drinks.  It is not cheap, but it is a great value if you are willing to go with a true condo approach versus a hotel scenario.

Exactly what we wanted!The reviews are consistent, and they are accurate.  Our stay was flawless.  Selfishly I'd almost rather not boast about how great it is to keep it a quiet gem.   We checked in to the kindest reception I've ever received, we were whisked up to our unit, shown all of the details, parking spot, etc in minutes, and we were enjoying a nice cold drink 10 minutes after we drove in the driveway. If you read these reviews, choose to stay here, and then go online and complain about the lack of F&B service - you're foolish.  It is clear there is no restaurant or bar on site.  That is WHY we chose it and are thrilled with our choice. Here are a couple things we did that made things even slicker: 1. Rent a car.  This is not an option.  You NEED a car.

We have stayed at many of the other properties on the island.  The Venetian was perfect on so many levels:  1. The water in front of the Venetian is extremely calm.  This is because the Venetian beach faces west.  During the summer months, trade wind is often very strong and comes from the east.  The Venetian location shields its beach from most of the trade wind.  This is critical if you have little ones that enjoy the ocean.  2. The kitchen is very well stocked:  The kitchen had everything we could have wanted.  Champaign flutes, wine glasses, plastic cups for the beach.  It even had a beacon rack to make that perfect beacon in the morning.  3. Absolute peace and quiet: The rooms are very large.

We stayed in the penthouse and felt SO pampered!  The view out each of our windows was AMAZING, the attention to detail within our condo was thoughtful and perfect. Each and every question/request was promptly addressed during our stay. And ...  Coleen graciously and pleasantly answered each and every one of our pre-vacation questions and concerns.

The location on Grace Bay is perfect. It was quiet and relaxing and the convenience of being steps away from the water was great. The water was pristine and fun for family snorkeling. A great spot for families and just a short bike ride into town for quaint shopping and great restaurants. The 3 bedroom unit was absolutely gorgeous and the added daily room cleaning was fantastic.

It exceeded all of our expectations. We stayed in unit 701 which was spacious, clean and had the most breathtaking views of Grace Bay beach. One of the unexpected bonuses at The Venetian was the daily housekeeping service. We would return from a morning at the beach and all of our dishes were in the dishwasher and our beds were made. Another aspect that we loved about The Venetian was the availability of beach chairs and umbrellas. We never worried about rushing downstairs to reserve a beach chair because there were plenty available.

Our condo was on the ground floor so we literally walked out the back door to the beach, and the front door to the pool. The condo was huge with high ceilings, clean, and newly renovated so we were in heaven with the finest amenities, kitchen, fabulous master bathroom, and a screened in porch.  We could open our enormous sliding glass doors and create an indoor/outdoor living room.  No restaurants on site - a few very good ones within walking distance, and many just a short cab ride away.

This was our 5th trip to Provo but the first time at this property.  It won’t be our last.  All condos have the same view-ocean front with huge screen porches.  We were in 402 and our condo was decorated beautifully.  It was clean and spacious. The television had a good variety of channels and the WiFi worked well.  The kitchen had everything.  They provide basic toiletries, coffee, creamer, sugar, paper towels, bottled water and laundry detergent.  Housekeeping came every day.  It was wonderful. Everyone who works on the property was very nice.    I love the location of the Venetian. It’s down at the end of the beach and it’s not crowded at all.

The water/beach are simply amazing and pictures honestly don't do it justice.  The Venetian property was immaculate and you would not know the hurricanes went through just months prior to our visit if you didn't leave the property.  I arrived late afternoon and was greeted warmly by the friendly staff.  There are restaurants within walking distance or a short drive, but I enjoyed cooking in the wonderful kitchen.  You have the  Graceway IGA less than 10 minutes away or the Graceway gourmet 3 minutes away to shop.  The condo was gorgeous with million dollar views.

The facilities are beautiful and impeccably maintained.  Walking the beach is like walking in a postcard.  The Venetian is very private and on the end of Grace Bay (beautiful views and on the beach) - it is not busy at all.  Many times we felt as if we had the beach to ourselves.

She knew we were exhausted from our late flight and didn't bother us with anything that most hotel employees do at check in. She let us know exactly what we needed to know for our first night: she gave us a cell phone to call her at any time if we needed anything (pure excellence), walked us to the restaurant, and told us the wifi password.

WOW!! I did much research and based on other positive reviews on TripAdvisor this place  lived up to the hype. Coleen was great to work with in requesting 1st floor room for easier access to the beach. She didn't disappoint and we got what I think is the best room @ Venetian  (#104). Was greeted by Ornella and check in was swift and simple as she gave my wife a tour of the facilities while I parked the rental car in our assigned spot. While providing a tour of room our luggage was brought to the room. Showed us the wifi code, automatic gate opener as well as the code to enter when entering  this gated palace, and cell phone provided which we did use to confirm a snorkeling trip. Accommodations were incredible.

The accommodations are spectacular - so spacious and beautifully decorated. We stayed in #604 which had 3 bedrooms and 3 ½ bathrooms with an extensive balcony overlooking the gorgeous beach. If you open the sliding door to the balcony in the master bedroom at night the sound of the ocean will definitely put you to sleep! Since this is a corner unit, the view is just boundless. The resort beach is private to those staying there and is just lovely with the softest sand and turquoise water. The resort itself is so welcoming and the support staff is first rate – Terria, Coleen and Ornella and others. They are very accommodating and make your stay comfortable and memorable.

I love the modern amenities and a good mix of modern and beach feel to the unit.  The view was excellent from the 6th floor.  We ate all our meals on the screened balcony.  There is really nothing negative I can say about the property itself.  Because it is located at the end of the resort area, it is very quiet, the beach itself is never crowded and it's very relaxing.  I would not hesitate to come back.  This was our second visit to Providenciales and first with our young children, and they loved it as well.Read moreDate of stay: March 2017HelpfulShare Response from VenetianGraceBay, Manager at The Venetian on Grace BayResponded 4 Jun 2017\"I would not hesitate to come back\" - we love these words and look forward to hosting you again real soon!

I love that we all feel so comfortable in the villa - we had ample room for anything whether its to read quietly on the huge balcony or play a board game or watch a movie as a family.  It's so nice to be in such a quiet, resort setting that has all the comforts of home, all the amenities of an upscale hotel and all the privacy of an exclusive celebrity hideaway.  That's the type of vacation our family enjoys - we don't care if we ever bump into a person on the beach! We will most certainly be back and our kids are already trying to persuade us to reserve a penthouse;) Coleen and Ornella in the front office were AMAZING at helping us do and see everything we wanted on this trip.

The condo was an end unit on the 2nd floor, which was equipped with everything we needed to enjoy our vacation. The 2nd floor was also nice because we didn't need to wait for an elevator or climb many stairs. This unit was managed by Island Escapes, which we highly recommend booking through.   The beach is *of course* breathtaking and The Venetian is located at the end of resort strip which makes it desirable because it's quiet. Poolside & Beachside Wi-Fi was a huge bonus!Read moreDate of stay: January 2017HelpfulShare Response from VenetianGraceBay, Manager at The Venetian on Grace BayResponded 1 Feb 2017Thanks very much for writing a review about our resort - we're happy to hear that you've enjoyed your stay with us at The Venetian on Grace Bay.Read morePreviousNext1…1516171819…57Not the right property for you?There are more places to choose from in the Grace Bay area.See all propertiesPRICE RANGE<U+20B9> 50,949 - <U+20B9> 86,485 (Based on Average Rates for a Standard Room) LOCATIONCaribbeanTurks and CaicosProvidencialesGrace BayNUMBER OF ROOMS27Is This Your Tripadvisor Listing?Own or manage this property?
